    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional multipliers worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Aerodight` *2 after fully charged\n",
    "- `Iris` *2 with strong attack\n",
    "- `Water Hag decoction` *1.5, need full vitality\n",
    "- superior oil *1.5\n",
    "- grindstone *1.2\n",
    "- `Cat School Techniques`, fast attack damage *1.2\n",
    "- `Bear School Techniques`, strong attack damage *1.2 though with significant stamina regen problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resistance worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- 99% is the maximum, significantly stronger near 99%\n",
    "- `Undvik` set for general protection with emphasis on against human, `Ursine` set for general protection with emphasis on against monster, `Tousissant knight's tourney` set for protection against human only\n",
    "- `Protective Coating` gives 25%/15% before/after 4.0.0, which is a significant nerf\n",
    "- `Arachas decoction` required after 4.0.0 in most situations to get near to 99%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swords worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- forged/fixed-leveled sword (like you always get `Iris` at level +37) will be capped at certain level (level 38 for `Iris`) on 1st run, thus less preferred when you reach higher levels on 1st run\n",
    "- forged/fixed-leveled sword can reach beyond level 100 on ng+, making them highly preferred on NG+. To maximize the effect, you will have to start NG+ at level 100\n",
    "- Why start NG+ at level 100? Because when you finally reach level 100, you want to face the guards with a level 148 `TKSS` rather than a lower level one\n",
    "- `Aerodight` will strike twice after charged, making it the best silver (when charged) of all time. Rending charges 2 stacks per hit. Rending on 10 stacks grants two permant damage instead of 1.\n",
    "- Any high level silver sword has a potential to better `Aerodight` in the first few strikes, but as none silver sword can achieve level 200 stats, Aerogight is always better after that\n",
    "- `Hjalmar's sword` (level 99, 200% crit dmg) has the highest critical damage bonus, making it the best steel on 1st run. However, you will have to reach level 100 before `King's Gambit` when you acquire this sword. On NG+, this wil be outscaled as one can have swords beyond level 100, and based damage scales fast under Euphoria.\n",
    "- `Iris` will strike twice when using strong attacks (including rend), making it the best steel to be used with strong attacks on NG+ being level 137, as none steel sword can achieve level 274 stats\n",
    "- `Toussaint Knight's Steel Sword`, level 148, best for fast attacks on NG+\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abilities worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Acquired Tolerance`, for Euphoria\n",
    "- `Synergy`, gives +0.5 (multiplied by euphoria)\n",
    "- `Killing Spree`, ensures critical, +2\n",
    "- `Protective Coating`, must have on death march, with Undvik armor or ursine armor for highest resistance. This skill does not work with the double skill glitch. Significantly nerfed after 4.0.0, now 99% resistance would require not only `Protective Coating` but also Arachas decoction with limited weight\n",
    "- `Hightened Tolerance`, not necessary before 4.0.0, avoid health drop after 4.0.0 (with limited toxity), ensures Water hag decoction's function, *1.5\n",
    "- `Cat School Techniques`, +1, at the expense of -0.15 (multiplied by euphoria) of a potential red skill, and *1.2 on fast damage, always worth it; Griffin School Techiniques still competitive though\n",
    "- `Fast metabolism`, only required before consuming decoctions, necessary to be constant active after 4.0.0 in some situations\n",
    "- `Euphoria` is significantly nerfed after 4.0.0, not only in terms of buff intensity but also requires additional skills to ensure 100% vitality / Water Hag decoction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game version worth mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4.0.0 nerfed `Euphoria`, `Protective Coating`, toxity, and disabled continuous rend, making the game much harder on Death March, both in terms of damage output and tanking capbility. Strange decisions on a single player game. I'd suggest play on earlier verions, and you can always upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- double `Acquired Tolerance`? [Glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhcWK4XNHvI)! Sorry I cannot find a non-video version that makes the process clear enough.\n",
    "- `Hjalmar's Steel Sword` with level 99 and 200% critical damage? You need to [spam save load to acquire this](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/702760-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/78453604). I made it using an [AHK script](https://github.com/mkmark/ahk-witcher3-hjalmars-steel-sword) (70 times before getting the first 'perfect' sword).\n",
